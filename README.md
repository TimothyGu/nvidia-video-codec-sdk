# nvidia-video-codec-sdk

This repository contains the headers in the [NVIDIA Video Codec
SDK](https://developer.nvidia.com/nvidia-video-codec-sdk) that are legal for me
to distribute. Check the license header in every individual files to make sure
it is legal for you to use, since they may differ.

These headers were from 7.1 (7.1.9) release of the SDK
(`Video_Codec_SDK_7.1.9.zip`).

Headers from other releases are accessible in other branches.
